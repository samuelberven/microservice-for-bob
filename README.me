# Random Number Generator Microservice

A simple microservice built with **ZeroMQ** to communicate between a client and server. The client sends a request (in the form of a stringified integer) to the server, which responds with a JSON array containing a specified number of random integers.

## Features

- **ZeroMQ Communication**: The server and client communicate over ZeroMQ using socket-based messaging.
- **Random Number Generation**: The server generates a list of random integers based on the clientâ€™s request.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Clients can specify the number of random numbers, as well as optional upper and lower bounds for the values.
